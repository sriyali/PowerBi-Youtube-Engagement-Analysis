#  Power BI Capstone Project â€“ YouTube Data Analysis

##  Overview

This project was completed as part of the Microsoft Power BI course by Intellipaat. The objective was to analyze a YouTube dataset to extract valuable insights about video performance, viewer engagement, and content strategies. The final deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard that empowers content creators and marketers with data-driven recommendations.

##  Project Description

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Built a decomposition tree to represent rank-wise categories
   - Created a blank button for page navigation
   - Formatted the report with headers and logos
   - Published the report to Power BI Service
   - Created a dashboard with 3 essential visuals
   - Exported the final report as PDF/PPT from Power BI Service
